## 2.4.0 - 2025-01-27

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone: VS Code Ingress Integration Complete

### Added

- **Version Display**: Version automatically displayed in web interface header
- **Build-Time Version Injection**: Single source of truth for version from config.json
- **VS Code Start/Stop Controls**: Fully functional VS Code management in both test-mode and addon-mode

### Fixed

- **ðŸ”§ VS Code Ingress URLs**: Complete fix for VS Code start/stop buttons not working in addon-mode
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Seamless operation in both Home Assistant ingress and direct access modes
- **URL Construction**: Intelligent detection and proper routing for API calls within ingress context

### Improved

- **Code Quality**: Clean, production-ready code without debugging artifacts
- **User Experience**: Reliable VS Code controls with proper status indication
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated version redundancy across codebase

### Technical Notes

- **Home Assistant Caching**: Discovered addon uninstall/reinstall required to clear HA's aggressive file caching
- **Ingress Context Detection**: Smart URL construction based on pathname analysis
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Verified working across different browsers

## 2.3.9 - 2025-01-27

### Added

- **Version Display**: Added version display in web interface header
- **Build-Time Version Injection**: Version is automatically extracted from config.json and injected into HTML during Docker build
- **VS Code Ingress Fix**: Fixed VS Code start/stop buttons not working in addon-mode with proper URL construction

### Improved

- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated version redundancy by using single source of truth (config.json)
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: VS Code buttons now work correctly in both test-mode and addon-mode

## 2.3.8 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **VS Code API URL Construction**: Fixed absolute URL construction for Home Assistant ingress context
- **Ingress Path Resolution**: Uses `window.location.pathname` to build proper ingress URLs  
- **API Call Routing**: Ensures API calls stay within addon's ingress context (`/addon_slug/ingress/api/vscode/status`)
- **Frontend Fix**: Addresses issue where relative URLs weren't resolving correctly in ingress mode

### Technical Details

- Changed getApiUrl() to build absolute URLs using current window location
- Constructs URLs like: `origin + pathname + '/' + endpoint`
- Should resolve to proper ingress URLs instead of breaking out to HA root
- Maintains compatibility with test-mode using relative paths

## 2.3.6 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **VS Code API URLs in Addon-Mode**: Improved URL resolution for Home Assistant ingress context
- **Ingress Detection**: Added smart detection of ingress vs test mode for proper API URLs
- **URL Construction**: Uses `new URL()` constructor for proper relative URL resolution
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Enhanced support for both addon-mode and test-mode API calls

### Technical Details

- Added `getApiUrl()` function that detects ingress context by checking pathname
- In ingress mode: uses `new URL(endpoint, currentUrl)` for proper resolution
- In test mode: uses simple relative paths as before
- Should resolve API calls to correct ingress URLs instead of Home Assistant root

## 2.3.5 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **Circular Dependency**: Removed circular dependency between vscode-api and user services
- **Test-Mode Compatibility**: Fixed s6-rc-compile error that prevented test-mode startup
- **Service Architecture**: vscode-api no longer depends on user service to avoid dependency loop
- **Startup Reliability**: Timeout mechanism handles initialization without requiring dependency

### Technical Details

- Removed `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/vscode-api/dependencies.d/user` dependency file
- user bundle includes vscode-api, so vscode-api cannot depend on user (circular)
- Timeout mechanism in vscode-api/run script handles `/tmp/.init-complete` gracefully
- Both test-mode and addon-mode now start services correctly

## 2.3.4 - 2025-01-27

### Improved

- **VS Code Service Reliability**: Added timeout mechanism to vscode-api service startup
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Better handling of test-mode vs addon-mode differences  
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents infinite waiting if user service fails to start
- **Startup Robustness**: 5-second timeout with fallback for edge cases

### Technical Details

- Added timeout loop (10 attempts Ã— 0.5s = 5 seconds max) for `/tmp/.init-complete`
- Different behavior for addon-mode (longer wait) vs test-mode (shorter wait)
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of startup issues
- Prevents the service from hanging indefinitely in edge cases

## 2.3.3 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **Service Dependencies**: Added missing user service dependency for vscode-api service
- **Startup Sequence**: Ensures `/tmp/.init-complete` is created before vscode-api starts waiting for it
- **Fresh Installations**: Prevents vscode-api from hanging indefinitely on first startup
- **Service Reliability**: Improves overall service startup reliability and order

### Technical Details

- Created `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/vscode-api/dependencies.d/user` dependency file
- Ensures user service (which creates `/tmp/.init-complete`) runs before vscode-api service
- Prevents the initialization deadlock that required manual intervention
- All fresh installations should now start VS Code API service correctly

## 2.3.2 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **VS Code API URL Resolution**: Improved fix for VS Code control buttons in addon-mode
- **Ingress Context**: Changed from `./api/vscode/*` to `api/vscode/*` for better ingress compatibility  
- **Service Dependencies**: Fixed user service not starting automatically, which caused vscode-api to wait indefinitely
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Ensures VS Code buttons work correctly in both test-mode and addon-mode

### Technical Details

- Root cause was user service not running â†’ `/tmp/.init-complete` never created â†’ vscode-api stuck waiting
- Fixed service dependency chain to ensure proper startup sequence
- Improved API URL construction for Home Assistant ingress context
- Backend VS Code API server functionality confirmed working correctly

## 2.3.1 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **VS Code Start/Stop Buttons**: Fixed VS Code control buttons not working in addon-mode
- **API URL Resolution**: Changed from absolute paths (`/api/vscode/*`) to relative paths (`./api/vscode/*`)
- **Home Assistant Ingress**: VS Code API calls now stay within ingress context instead of breaking out to Home Assistant root
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: VS Code buttons now work correctly in both test-mode and addon-mode

### Technical Details

- The issue was that absolute API paths (`/api/vscode/status`) resolved to Home Assistant's root (`http://homeassistant.internal:8123/api/vscode/status`) in addon-mode
- Fixed by using relative paths (`./api/vscode/status`) which stay within the addon's ingress context
- Backend VS Code API server was working correctly - the issue was purely frontend URL resolution
- All API endpoints (`/api/vscode/status`, `/api/vscode/start`, `/api/vscode/stop`) now work in both modes

## 2.3.0 - 2025-01-27

### Added

- **VS Code Web Control Interface**: Start and stop VS Code directly from the addon's main web page
- **Real-time VS Code Status**: Live status indicator showing VS Code running/stopped state
- **VS Code API Server**: REST API endpoints for service control (`/api/vscode/status`, `/api/vscode/start`, `/api/vscode/stop`)
- **CPU Usage Optimization**: Stop VS Code when not needed to reduce CPU usage by ~50%
- **Auto-refresh Status**: VS Code status automatically updates every 30 seconds
- **Interactive Control Buttons**: Start/Stop buttons with visual feedback and loading states
- **Command Line Tools**: Added `vscode-toggle` script for manual VS Code control via SSH

### Changed

- Enhanced main dashboard with VS Code control panel including status and buttons
- Added new s6-overlay service `vscode-api` for web-based VS Code management
- Updated NGINX configuration to route VS Code API requests

- All new functionality is additive - existing features unchanged
- Proper error handling and graceful fallbacks for all control operations
