## 2.6.4 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Fixed: Removed Inconsistent VS Code Direct Link

### Removed

- **VS Code Direct Link**: Removed `üöÄ Direct VS Code (Port 8443)` link as it was inconsistent with the logical pattern

### Technical Details

**Consistent Logic Applied:**
- **Direct links provided**: Only for services with **ingress limitations** that need port access as backup
- **No direct links**: For services that work fine through Home Assistant's ingress system

**Current Status:**
- **‚úÖ Prometheus**: Direct link (Port 9090) - Has ingress limitations (fails in Addon-mode)
- **‚úÖ Grafana**: Direct link (Port 3000) - Has ingress limitations (doesn't work through ingress)
- **‚ùå VS Code**: No direct link - Works perfectly through ingress in all modes
- **‚ùå Alertmanager**: No direct link - Works perfectly through ingress  
- **‚ùå Blackbox**: No direct link - Works perfectly through ingress
- **‚ùå Karma**: No direct link - Works perfectly through ingress
- **‚ùå NGINX**: No direct link - Works perfectly through ingress

**Clarification:**
VS Code's previous start/stop button issues were **frontend API problems**, not ingress problems. The VS Code web interface itself works fine through Home Assistant's ingress system and doesn't require direct port access.

**JavaScript Changes:**
- Removed `setupDirectLink('vscode-direct-link', 8443, 'VS Code');` call
- Simplified direct link management to only handle Prometheus and Grafana

This creates a clear, logical pattern where direct links are only provided for services that actually need them.

## 2.6.3 - 2025-06-30

### üé® Simplified: Removed Colored Service Card Borders

### Removed

- **Colored Left Borders**: Removed all colored left border styling from service cards for cleaner, more uniform appearance
- **CSS Classes**: Removed `.limited`, `.controllable`, and `.limited.controllable` styling classes
- **Visual Complexity**: Simplified service card design to focus on content rather than visual indicators

### Technical Details

**CSS Changes:**
- Removed colored border-left styling rules
- Standardized all service cards to use the same white background and subtle shadow
- Removed class-based visual differentiation system

**HTML Changes:**
- Removed all CSS class attributes from service card divs
- All service cards now use the standard `.service-card` class only

**Result:**
All service cards now have a clean, uniform appearance without colored borders. Service characteristics (ingress limitations, controllable features) are still clearly described in the text content but no longer indicated through visual styling.

## 2.6.2 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Fixed: Link Consistency & Restored Missing Service

### Fixed

- **Restored Karma Service**: Added back the missing Karma alert dashboard service card that was accidentally removed
- **Link Icon Consistency**: Fixed NGINX status link to use consistent üîó icon instead of üìà
- **Direct Link Messages**: Standardized VS Code direct link message format to match Prometheus/Grafana pattern `(Port XXXX - Checking...)`
- **CSS Classes**: Added proper `controllable` class to VS Code and Grafana service cards for visual consistency
- **Service Organization**: Restored proper section comments for better code organization

### Technical Details

**Link Pattern Standardization:**
- **Ingress Links**: All use üîó icon with consistent formatting
- **Direct Links**: All use üöÄ icon with consistent `(Port XXXX - Checking...)` format
- **Health/Status**: All use üè• icon for health endpoints
- **Metrics**: All use üìà icon for metrics endpoints

**Service Classification:**
- `limited`: Services with ingress limitations (Prometheus, Grafana)
- `controllable`: Services with start/stop controls (VS Code, Grafana) 
- `limited controllable`: Services with both characteristics (Grafana)

**Current Link Status:**
- **Services with Ingress + Direct**: Prometheus, Grafana, VS Code
- **Services with Ingress Only**: Alertmanager, Blackbox, Karma, NGINX
- **Consistent Explanatory Text**: Applied where relevant for user clarity

## 2.6.1 - 2025-06-30

### üé® UI/UX: Consistent Service Card Layout

### Changed

- **Service Card Organization**: Reorganized services into logical groups (Core Monitoring ‚Üí Visualization ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Infrastructure)
- **Consistent Structure**: Standardized all service cards to follow the same layout pattern (description ‚Üí notes ‚Üí limitations ‚Üí controls ‚Üí links)
- **Link Organization**: Consistent link ordering across all services (UI ‚Üí Direct ‚Üí Health ‚Üí Metrics ‚Üí Special)
- **Visual Consistency**: Unified styling with consistent colors, spacing, and typography
- **CSS Classes**: Introduced semantic classes (`controllable`, `limited`) with visual indicators
- **Terminology**: Updated naming to use official convention (Test-mode, Addon-mode)

### Technical Details

**Card Structure Standardization:**
- Description section (all services)
- Notes section (where applicable) 
- Limitations section (where applicable)
- Status controls (controllable services)
- Links section (consistent ordering)

**Visual Improvements:**
- Color-coded service types with left border indicators
- Consistent note and limitation styling with proper backgrounds
- Improved button and link styling
- Better spacing and typography hierarchy

**Logical Grouping:**
1. **Core Monitoring**: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Blackbox Exporter
2. **Visualization**: Grafana, Karma  
3. **Development**: VS Code
4. **Infrastructure**: NGINX Status

This creates a more professional, organized interface while preserving all accurate technical information and functionality.

## 2.6.0 - 2025-06-30

- **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into service states
- **Consistency**: Unified control interface matching VS Code implementation

This brings Grafana service management to parity with VS Code, providing users complete control over resource-intensive services.

## 2.5.15 - 2025-06-30

### üè∑Ô∏è Standardization: Official Naming Convention

### Fixed

- **Naming Convention Alignment**: Standardized all test scripts to use official mode naming convention
- **Consistent Terminology**: Replaced inconsistent mode references throughout test infrastructure

### Changed

- **Test Scripts Naming**: Updated all references to use official three-mode convention:
  - **Test-mode**: Local development environment (Cursor AI)
  - **Github-mode**: CI/CD environment (GitHub Actions)  
  - **Addon-mode**: Real Home Assistant add-on environment
- **Script Messages**: Updated user-facing messages to match official convention
- **Documentation Alignment**: Ensured all test scripts follow README.md naming standards

### Technical Details

**Before**: Mixed terminology ("addon mode", "GitHub Actions mode", "local test mode")
**After**: Consistent official naming (Test-mode, Github-mode, Addon-mode)

**Files Updated**:
- `test/build-test.sh`: Header and startup messages
- `test/health-check.sh`: Environment detection and debug messages

This eliminates confusion and ensures consistent terminology across all project documentation and code.

## 2.5.14 - 2025-06-30

### üîó UI/UX: Intelligent Direct Access Links

### Fixed

- **Broken VS Code Direct Link**: Fixed broken link to `http://homeassistant.internal:8443/` when port is disabled
- **Misleading Link Behavior**: All direct links now show actual accessibility status instead of blindly linking
- **User Experience**: No more broken links - disabled ports show helpful alerts with configuration instructions

### Added

- **Smart Link Detection**: All direct access links (Prometheus, Grafana, VS Code) now check port accessibility
- **Dynamic Status Updates**: Links show "Checking..." ‚Üí "Available" or "Disabled" based on actual port status
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Disabled ports provide clear instructions on which port to enable in addon config
- **Visual Feedback**: Disabled links are styled differently to indicate unavailable features

### Technical Details

**Before**: Static links regardless of port configuration ‚Üí broken links for disabled ports
**After**: Dynamic port accessibility checking with user-friendly feedback

**Implementation**: 
- Single `setupDirectLink()` function handles all three services (DRY principle)
- Non-blocking `fetch()` checks with graceful fallback
- Consistent UX across Prometheus (9090), Grafana (3000), and VS Code (8443)

## 2.5.12 - 2025-06-30

### ‚ö° Performance: Optimized Timeout Handling

### Changed

- **Service Startup Performance**: Replaced fixed timeouts with responsive condition-checking loops
- **Grafana Health Checks**: Reduced retry interval from 2s ‚Üí 0.5s (4x faster response)
- **VS Code API Service**: Replaced fixed 3-second delay with dynamic s6-overlay readiness checking
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Reduced retry intervals from 2s ‚Üí 0.5s for faster feedback
- **Container Cleanup**: Improved stop-checking responsiveness from 2s ‚Üí 0.5s intervals

### Technical Details

**Before**: Fixed delays regardless of actual service readiness
**After**: Dynamic condition checking with 0.5s intervals for optimal responsiveness

**Timeout Period Maintenance:**
- **Grafana**: 30‚Üí120 attempts to maintain 60-second total timeout (30√ó2s ‚Üí 120√ó0.5s)
- **Cleanup**: 30‚Üí120 attempts to maintain 60-second total timeout (30√ó2s ‚Üí 120√ó0.5s)
- **Response time**: 4x faster when services are ready (2s ‚Üí 0.5s intervals)

**VS Code Service Improvements:**
- Replaced `sleep 3` with condition check for `s6-svstat` and `s6-rc` availability
- Removed unnecessary `sleep 1` delay in test mode
- Added timeout protection (6 seconds max) with graceful fallback

### Impact

- **Faster Startup**: Services respond immediately when ready instead of waiting for fixed delays
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Reduced unnecessary CPU idle time during startup
- **Improved CI/CD**: 4x faster feedback loops in GitHub Actions
- **More Reliable**: Dynamic condition checking vs blind waiting prevents race conditions

## 2.5.11 - 2025-06-30

### üîß CRITICAL FIX: s6-overlay Service Dependencies

### Fixed

- **s6-overlay Service Dependencies**: Corrected ALL service dependency files to be properly empty as per official s6-overlay documentation
- **Service Startup Issues**: Fixed potential service startup problems across the entire stack
- **Documentation Compliance**: Aligned with official s6-overlay documentation requirement for empty dependency files

### Root Cause

All s6-overlay service dependency files incorrectly contained service names when they should be empty files. According to the official s6-overlay documentation, dependency files in `dependencies.d/` should be empty files where the **filename** (not content) indicates the dependency.

### Technical Details

**Affected Files:**
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/vscode-api/dependencies.d/legacy-cont-init`
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/prometheus/dependencies.d/blackbox-exporter`
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/prometheus/dependencies.d/legacy-cont-init`
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/user/dependencies.d/legacy-cont-init`
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/karma/dependencies.d/prometheus`
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/karma/dependencies.d/alertmanager`
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/grafana/dependencies.d/prometheus`
- `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/alertmanager/dependencies.d/legacy-cont-init`

**Before**: Files contained service names (e.g., "prometheus ", "legacy-cont-init")
**After**: All files are empty (0 bytes) with correct filename-based dependency resolution

### Impact

- **Service Reliability**: Ensures proper s6-overlay service dependency resolution
- **Startup Consistency**: Eliminates potential service startup race conditions
- **Documentation Compliance**: Follows official s6-overlay best practices
- **All Environments**: Improves reliability across test mode, addon mode, and CI/CD environments

## 2.5.10 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Critical Fix: Grafana Service Startup in Addon Mode

### Fixed

- **Grafana Service Dependencies**: Fixed malformed dependency file that prevented Grafana from starting in addon mode and GitHub Actions
- **s6-overlay Dependency Resolution**: Grafana dependency file now correctly references "prometheus " instead of empty space
- **Environment-Specific Startup**: Grafana now starts consistently across all environments (test mode, addon mode, GitHub Actions)

### Root Cause

The Grafana service dependency file `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/grafana/dependencies.d/prometheus` contained only a space character instead of the service name "prometheus ". This malformed dependency prevented s6-overlay from properly resolving the service dependency tree in strict environments (addon mode, GitHub Actions), causing Grafana to never start.

### Technical Details

**Before**: 
- Dependency file: `00000000  20` (space character only)
- Result: s6-overlay cannot resolve Grafana dependencies ‚Üí service never starts

**After**:
- Dependency file: `70 72 6f 6d 65 74 68 65 75 73 20 0a` ("prometheus " + newline)  
- Result: s6-overlay properly starts Grafana after Prometheus is ready

### Impact

- **Test Mode**: No change (was working due to lenient dependency checking)
- **Addon Mode**: Grafana now starts and is accessible at `http://homeassistant.internal:3000/`
- **GitHub Actions**: Grafana now starts properly in CI environment
- **User Experience**: Complete monitoring stack now works in all deployment modes

## 2.5.9 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Enhancement: Complete Testing Suite for All Components

### Added

- **Comprehensive Grafana Testing**: Added Grafana to all test scripts with health checks, configuration validation, and functionality testing
- **Complete VS Code Testing**: Added proper VS Code testing with HTTP status code validation (302 redirect handling)
- **Enhanced build-test.sh**: Now documents all 7 services including Grafana URLs and ingress paths
- **Enhanced health-check.sh**: Now tests all 7 services with individual health checks and functionality tests

### Fixed

- **Missing Component Documentation**: Fixed build-test.sh to include Grafana service URLs, health endpoints, and ingress paths
- **Incomplete Health Checks**: Added Grafana and VS Code to comprehensive health check suite
- **VS Code Test Method**: Fixed VS Code test to properly handle 302 redirects (working behavior)
- **Grafana JSON Parsing**: Fixed Grafana health test to properly parse JSON response format

### Technical Details

**Now Testing All 7 Services:**
1. ‚úÖ Prometheus (metrics collection)
2. ‚úÖ Alertmanager (alert management) 
3. ‚úÖ Blackbox Exporter (endpoint monitoring)
4. ‚úÖ Karma (alert dashboard)
5. ‚úÖ **Grafana** (visualization - newly added)
6. ‚úÖ **VS Code** (development environment - newly added)
7. ‚úÖ NGINX (ingress proxy)

**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
- **6 Configuration Files**: All service configs validated
- **3 Data Directories**: All persistent storage checked  
- **8 Functionality Tests**: All services + ingress proxy paths
- **7 Basic Health Checks**: Individual service health validation
- **6 Ingress Paths**: All subpath routing tested

### Impact

- **Complete Test Coverage**: Every component in the stack is now properly tested
- **Accurate Documentation**: build-test.sh reflects all available services and endpoints
- **Reliable Health Checks**: Comprehensive validation ensures all services are working correctly
- **Development Confidence**: Full test suite provides confidence in addon functionality

## 2.5.8 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Critical Fix: Grafana Network Binding in Addon Mode

### Fixed

- **Grafana Network Accessibility**: Fixed timeout issue when accessing Grafana on port 3000 in addon mode
- **Network Binding**: Added `http_addr = 0.0.0.0` to grafana.ini to bind to all interfaces
- **Container Networking**: Grafana now accessible from outside the addon container via `http://homeassistant.internal:3000/`

### Root Cause

Grafana was defaulting to bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) inside the addon container, making it inaccessible from the Home Assistant host. Other services (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Blackbox Exporter) already used proper network binding (`:PORT` format = `0.0.0.0:PORT`).

### Technical Details

**Before**: Grafana bound to `127.0.0.1:3000` (localhost only)
**After**: Grafana binds to `0.0.0.0:3000` (all interfaces)

This matches the network configuration pattern used by other services in the stack.

### Impact

- **Test Mode**: No change (already worked)
- **Addon Mode**: Grafana now accessible via direct port access as intended
- **User Experience**: Direct Grafana link now works in both modes

## 2.5.7 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Documentation Fix: Corrected Ingress Behavior Descriptions

### Fixed

- **Prometheus Documentation**: Corrected to accurately reflect that Prometheus ingress works in test mode due to relative redirects
- **Grafana Documentation**: Fixed to clearly explain absolute redirect issue (`/login` vs `/grafana/login`) that breaks all ingress access
- **Redirect Behavior Analysis**: Documented the crucial difference between relative redirects (Prometheus) and absolute redirects (Grafana)
- **Mode-Specific Behavior**: Clarified test mode vs addon mode differences for both services

### Technical Clarification

**Prometheus (‚úÖ Test Mode, ‚ùå Addon Mode):**
- Uses relative redirects that resolve within ingress context in test mode
- Still fails in addon mode due to Home Assistant's complex ingress URL structure

**Grafana (‚ùå All Modes):**
- Uses absolute redirects (`/login`) that break out of ingress context in any mode
- Requires direct port access (3000) for functionality

### User Interface Updates

- **Prometheus Link**: Changed from "Broken in Ingress" ‚Üí "Works in Test Mode"
- **Grafana Link**: Changed from "Limited in Ingress" ‚Üí "Broken - Absolute Redirects"  
- **Recommendation Updates**: Prometheus "Recommended" vs Grafana "Required" for direct access

## 2.5.6 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Critical Correction: Addon Mode vs Test Mode Analysis

### Fixed

- **Addon Mode Behavior**: Corrected analysis to properly account for Home Assistant ingress context
- **Both Services Limited**: Both Prometheus and Grafana have ingress limitations in addon mode
- **Root Cause**: Absolute redirects (`/graph`, `/login`) break out of ingress context in addon mode
- **Documentation**: Updated nginx comments to reflect the correct behavior in addon mode

### Key Discovery: Test Mode ‚â† Addon Mode

**Test Mode Behavior:**
- Prometheus: `/prometheus/` ‚Üí redirects to `/graph` ‚Üí works (shorter path context)
- Grafana: `/grafana/` ‚Üí redirects to `/login` ‚Üí limited by `<base href="/">`

**Addon Mode Behavior (Home Assistant Ingress):**
- Prometheus: `/addon_slug/ingress/prometheus/` ‚Üí redirects to `/graph` ‚Üí breaks out of ingress context ‚ùå
- Grafana: `/addon_slug/ingress/grafana/` ‚Üí redirects to `/login` ‚Üí breaks out of ingress context ‚ùå

### Technical Analysis

Both services fail in addon mode due to **absolute path redirects** that break out of the `/addon_slug/ingress/` context:
- Prometheus redirects to `/graph` instead of relative path
- Grafana redirects to `/login` instead of relative path  
- Both redirects escape the Home Assistant ingress URL structure

### Impact

This explains why both Grafana links appear broken in the user's addon mode testing, despite appearing to work differently in test mode.

## 2.5.5 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Major Correction: Prometheus Ingress Actually Works

### Fixed

- **Prometheus Documentation**: Corrected major error - Prometheus does NOT have ingress limitations
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Prometheus uses relative paths (`./static/js/...`) which work perfectly with subpath routing
- **Technical Accuracy**: Updated nginx comments to reflect that Prometheus ingress routing works correctly
- **Grafana vs Prometheus**: Clarified the actual difference - only Grafana has the `<base href="/">` limitation

### Key Discovery

The fundamental difference between Prometheus and Grafana:

**Prometheus (‚úÖ Works with Ingress):**
- Uses relative paths: `src="./static/js/main.js"`
- Path resolution: `/prometheus/` + `./static/js/main.js` = `/prometheus/static/js/main.js` ‚úÖ

**Grafana (‚ùå Limited with Ingress):**  
- Uses `<base href="/">` + relative paths: `href="public/img/icon.png"`
- Path resolution: `/grafana/` + `public/img/icon.png` + `<base href="/">` = `/public/img/icon.png` ‚ùå

### Impact

This correction means users can confidently use Prometheus through both ingress and direct access methods.

## 2.5.4 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Fixed: Grafana Direct Access

### Fixed

- **Grafana Port 3000**: Enabled by default to make "Direct Grafana (Recommended)" link actually work
- **User Experience**: Fixed confusing situation where both Grafana links appeared broken
- **Port Configuration**: Updated port description to explain why port 3000 is now enabled
- **Consistent Functionality**: Direct Grafana link now works as intended and recommended

### Background

After documenting the Grafana ingress limitation in v2.5.3, both Grafana links appeared broken to users:
- Ingress link (`/grafana/`) had the documented `<base href="/">` limitation
- Direct link (port 3000) didn't work because the port wasn't exposed

This fix ensures the recommended "Direct Grafana" approach actually works by enabling port 3000 by default.

## 2.5.3 - 2025-06-30

### üîç Important Discovery: Grafana Ingress Limitation Documented

### Fixed

- **Grafana Ingress Documentation**: Properly documented that Grafana has the same ingress limitation as Prometheus
- **Subpath Routing Issue**: Confirmed Grafana uses `<base href="/">` which breaks subpath routing in Home Assistant ingress
- **User Interface**: Updated Grafana service card to show limitation warning and recommend direct port access
- **Nginx Configuration**: Added explanatory comments matching Prometheus limitation documentation
- **Consistency**: Both Prometheus and Grafana now properly documented as having the same fundamental limitation

### Root Cause Analysis

Modern web applications like Prometheus and Grafana use `<base href="/">` in their HTML, causing all relative URLs to resolve to the root path instead of the intended subpath (e.g., `/grafana/`). This breaks asset loading and navigation when deployed behind a reverse proxy with subpath routing.

### Technical Details

- **Base Href Issue**: `<base href="/">` in HTML causes `href="public/img/icon.png"` to resolve to `/public/img/icon.png` instead of `/grafana/public/img/icon.png`
- **Asset Loading Failure**: JavaScript, CSS, and images fail to load through ingress, causing "failed to load application files" errors
- **Redirect Problems**: Internal redirects go to root paths (`/login`) instead of subpaths (`/grafana/login`)
- **Same as Prometheus**: Both applications have identical architectural limitations for subpath deployment

### Recommendation

Use direct port access (port 3000 for Grafana, port 9090 for Prometheus) instead of ingress routing for full functionality.

## 2.5.2 - 2025-06-30

### üîß Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed

- **Grafana Service Not Starting**: Fixed critical issue where Grafana service was not being started by s6-overlay
- **Missing Service Bundle**: Added missing `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/user/contents.d/grafana` file
- **Service Integration**: Grafana now properly included in the user service bundle and starts automatically
- **Web Interface Access**: Grafana dashboard now accessible via `/grafana/` endpoint with proper nginx proxy
- **Health Check**: Grafana health endpoint now returns proper status (`{"database": "ok", "version": "11.3.1"}`)

### Root Cause

The Grafana service directory and configuration existed but was not included in the s6-overlay service bundle, causing the service to never start. This was due to the missing service bundle file that links Grafana to the user service tree.

### Impact

- **Before**: Grafana completely inaccessible, nginx returning 502 errors
- **After**: Full Grafana functionality restored with dashboard access and proper health checks

## 2.5.1 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **Grafana Service**: Fixed s6-rc-compile error caused by improper service type file formatting

## 2.3.8 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **VS Code API URL Construction**: Fixed absolute URL construction for Home Assistant ingress context
- **Ingress Path Resolution**: Uses `window.location.pathname` to build proper ingress URLs  
- **API Call Routing**: Ensures API calls stay within addon's ingress context (`/addon_slug/ingress/api/vscode/status`)
- **Frontend Fix**: Addresses issue where relative URLs weren't resolving correctly in ingress mode

### Technical Details

- Changed getApiUrl() to build absolute URLs using current window location
- Constructs URLs like: `origin + pathname + '/' + endpoint`
- Should resolve to proper ingress URLs instead of breaking out to HA root
- Maintains compatibility with test-mode using relative paths

## 2.3.6 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **VS Code API URLs in Addon-Mode**: Improved URL resolution for Home Assistant ingress context
- **Ingress Detection**: Added smart detection of ingress vs test mode for proper API URLs
- **URL Construction**: Uses `new URL()` constructor for proper relative URL resolution
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Enhanced support for both addon-mode and test-mode API calls

### Technical Details

- Added `getApiUrl()` function that detects ingress context by checking pathname
- In ingress mode: uses `new URL(endpoint, currentUrl)` for proper resolution
- In test mode: uses simple relative paths as before
- Should resolve API calls to correct ingress URLs instead of Home Assistant root

## 2.3.5 - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- **Circular Dependency**: Removed circular dependency between vscode-api and user services
- **Test-Mode Compatibility**: Fixed s6-rc-compile error that prevented test-mode startup
- **Service Architecture**: vscode-api no longer depends on user service to avoid dependency loop
- **Startup Reliability**: Timeout mechanism handles initialization without requiring dependency

### Technical Details

- Removed `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/vscode-api/dependencies.d/user` dependency file
- user bundle includes vscode-api, so vscode-api cannot depend on user (circular)
- Timeout mechanism in vscode-api/run script handles `/tmp/.init-complete` gracefully
- Both test-mode and addon-mode now start services correctly

## 2.3.4 - 2025-01-27

### Improved

- **VS Code Service Reliability**: Added timeout mechanism to vscode-api service startup
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Better handling of test-mode vs addon-mode differences  
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents infinite waiting if user service fails to start
- **Startup Robustness**: 5-second timeout with fallback for edge cases

### Technical Details

- Added timeout loop (10 attempts √ó 0.5s = 5 seconds max) for `/tmp/.init-complete`

- **Fresh Installations**: Prevents vscode-api from hanging indefinitely on first startup
- **Service Reliability**: Improves overall service startup reliability and order

### Technical Details

- Created `/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/vscode-api/dependencies.d/user` dependency file
- Ensures user service (which creates `/tmp/.init-complete`) runs before vscode-api service
- Prevents the initialization deadlock that required manual intervention
- All fresh installations should now start VS Code API service correctly

## 2.3.2 - 2025-01-27

### Technical Details

- The issue was that absolute API paths (`/api/vscode/status`) resolved to Home Assistant's root (`http://homeassistant.internal:8123/api/vscode/status`) in addon-mode
- Fixed by using relative paths (`./api/vscode/status`) which stay within the addon's ingress context
- Backend VS Code API server was working correctly - the issue was purely frontend URL resolution
- All API endpoints (`/api/vscode/status`, `/api/vscode/start`, `/api/vscode/stop`) now work in both modes
