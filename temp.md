# Structural Inconsistencies Progress

After reviewing the codebase, here are the structural inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

## âœ… COMPLETED: Documentation (README Files)

**Status: FIXED** - All README files now have consistent formatting:

- âœ… Consistent structure with numbered sections
- âœ… Standardized formatting and cross-references
- âœ… Table of Contents added to all README files
- âœ… Proper spacing with blank lines after headers and before lists
- âœ… Consistent support and license sections
- âœ… All emoji icons removed from section headers

## âœ… COMPLETED: S6-Overlay Service Scripts

**Status: FIXED** - All S6-Overlay service scripts now have consistent structure:

- âœ… Standardized shebang lines (`#!/command/with-contenv bashio`)
- âœ… Consistent timeout handling (30 attempts, 0.5s sleep, 15s total)
- âœ… Cross-mode compatible logging using `echo` (works in test, github, and addon modes)
- âœ… Added missing dependencies (legacy-cont-init to blackbox-exporter and nginx)
- âœ… Fixed undefined variables in karma run script
- âœ… Consistent logging format across all services
- âœ… All services have proper dependency declarations

## ðŸ”„ REMAINING: Test Scripts

  - The scripts have different header styles and documentation formats
  - Some scripts use different color definitions and print functions
  - Error handling is inconsistent across scripts
  - Variable naming conventions vary

## ðŸ”„ REMAINING: Configuration Files

  - Dashboard files use different JSON formatting styles
  - Configuration files are scattered across different directories
  - Some config files might be missing proper validation

**Next Priority:** Would you like me to continue with the Test Scripts inconsistencies next, or would you prefer to tackle the Configuration Files inconsistencies first?
