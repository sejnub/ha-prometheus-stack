# Structural Inconsistencies Progress

After reviewing the codebase, here are the structural inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

## âœ… COMPLETED: Documentation (README Files)

**Status: FIXED** - All README files now have consistent formatting:

- âœ… Consistent structure with numbered sections
- âœ… Standardized formatting and cross-references
- âœ… Table of Contents added to all README files
- âœ… Proper spacing with blank lines after headers and before lists
- âœ… Consistent support and license sections
- âœ… All emoji icons removed from section headers

## ðŸ”„ REMAINING: S6-Overlay Service Scripts

- The up scripts have consistent structure but could be improved with standardized timeouts and error messages
- Some services might be missing proper dependency declarations
- We should ensure all services have consistent file permissions

## ðŸ”„ REMAINING: Test Scripts

- The scripts have different header styles and documentation formats
- Some scripts use different color definitions and print functions
- Error handling is inconsistent across scripts
- Variable naming conventions vary

## ðŸ”„ REMAINING: Configuration Files

- Dashboard files use different JSON formatting styles
- Configuration files are scattered across different directories
- Some config files might be missing proper validation

**Next Priority:** Would you like me to continue with the S6-Overlay Service Scripts next, or would you prefer to tackle the Test Scripts inconsistencies first?
