After reviewing the codebase, here are the structural inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

- S6-Overlay Service Scripts:
  - The up scripts have consistent structure but could be improved with standardized timeouts and error messages
  - Some services might be missing proper dependency declarations
  - We should ensure all services have consistent file permissions

- Test Scripts:
  - The scripts have different header styles and documentation formats
  - Some scripts use different color definitions and print functions
  - Error handling is inconsistent across scripts
  - Variable naming conventions vary

- Configuration Files:
  - Dashboard files use different JSON formatting styles
  - Configuration files are scattered across different directories
  - Some config files might be missing proper validation

- Documentation:
  - README files have inconsistent formats across directories
  - Some directories are missing README files
  - Documentation style varies between files


Would you like me to start fixing these inconsistencies? I can tackle them one category at a time, starting with whichever you think is most important.
