# üîç Prometheus Stack Add-on for Home Assistant

A comprehensive monitoring stack for Home Assistant that includes Prometheus, Alertmanager, Karma, and Blackbox Exporter in a single add-on.


## Remember

- It must run equally well in the following modes

  - **Test mode**: When started on the development computer
  - **Github Mode**: When Run by Github actions
  - **Addon Mode**: When run as a home Assistant Add-On

- All waits must be loops that have a minimal fixed time (0.5 seconds) and then check what they are waiting for

- Question: Is it enough that the "build"-script relies on the folders "dependencies.d" or must each service wait for the previous one really answering
